# My_Julia_pkg
Julia function optimization

Julia is all in one language that is the "almost" best in all worlds by inheritance of all that's good, and scrap the legacy nonsense.
"almost" because you can't satisfy theme all. this is my small take on making the language perfect for me.
The package contains small tweeks like maximun -> max, ,minimum -> min.
